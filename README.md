# ForzaPython
Requires PyQt5

Personal python learning project using Forza data

Aint nothing pretty to look at, but it works for my intendeded function.
Never used Python before, haven't looked at any programming in 10-15 years easily, and was never that competent at the time. 
Initial version is just my initial attempt to crash course myself through the basics, and get something functional

ForzaTerminal was the first iteration I made as a quick version using console only. Not much use outside of leaving for legacy sake.

main.py is an actual GUI interface, albeit simple for the moment. The UI itself was made using QT Designer in Linux. 

Currently selecting Stock Buggy will crash it, haven't actually added anything for it. Using it as a placeholder for the odd cars that don't match the normal quick spring math.
