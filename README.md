# ForzaPython
Personal python learning project using Forza data

Aint nothing pretty to look at, but it works for my intendeded function.
Never used Python before, haven't looked at any programming in 10-15 years easily, and waste never that competent at the time. 
Initial version is just my initial attempt to crash course myself through the basics, and get something function.
Lacks any form of input/error control, and eventually want to move it to a web based input/output system and add other functionality.
